Tree-maze
=========

Project written during a Ludum Dare 48 hour game jam, to generate a walkable maze that is not defined in real space, but instead as an interconnected tree of corners, with loops which would be impossible in real world space (i.e. one end of a hallway can connect to the opposite end behind you).
No real game element added, was just an experiment to generate them at different sizes and see how they were to walk around in.

To run, simply open the index.html in the bin folder.
